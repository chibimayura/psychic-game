# psychic-game

An html & javascript game where you try to pretend you are psychic 
but you're not really psychic and you're really just pressing a bunch of buttons to guess what alphabet the computer choose.

Rules:
Hit any key on the keyboard until you guess the right letter.
You lose when you run out of guesses to make.
